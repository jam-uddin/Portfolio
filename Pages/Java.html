            <h1>My Java Experience</h1>
            <p>I have substantial experience with Java, having utilized it to develop the sophisticated and engaging game "Doughnut Defender." My work with Java has provided me with a robust understanding of object-oriented programming, game mechanics, and user interface design. Here are key highlights of my experience:</p>

            <h2>Doughnut Defender</h2>
            <h3>Project Overview</h3>
            <p>"Doughnut Defender" is a side-scrolling action game developed using Java. Players navigate through various levels, defending their doughnuts from enemies with different behaviors and attacks.</p>

            <h3>Key Contributions</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Gameplay Mechanics:</strong> Designed and implemented core gameplay mechanics, including player controls, enemy spawning, and power-up systems. Ensured smooth and responsive controls for character movement and combat actions.</li>
                <li><strong>Enemy AI:</strong> Developed diverse enemy types with distinct behaviors. Basic enemies attack directly, fast-moving enemies require quick reflexes, and flying enemies add vertical challenges. This variety keeps gameplay engaging and challenging.</li>
                <li><strong>Power-Ups and Upgrades:</strong> Created a variety of power-ups that provide temporary boosts, such as increased attack speed, invincibility, and health regeneration. Implemented a point system allowing players to purchase upgrades for their character, enhancing replayability and player engagement.</li>
                <li><strong>Level Design:</strong> Designed multiple levels with increasing difficulty, each presenting new challenges and requiring different strategies to complete. Levels are crafted to maintain player interest and provide a sense of progression.</li>
                <li><strong>User Interface:</strong> Developed an intuitive and interactive UI that displays crucial information such as health, score, and remaining doughnuts. Implemented menus for game start, pause, and end screens, ensuring a seamless user experience.</li>
                <li><strong>Audio Integration:</strong> Added background music and sound effects to enhance the gaming experience. Implemented audio triggers for events like enemy appearances and power-up collections, contributing to an immersive gameplay environment.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Technical Skills and Tools</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Multithreading:</strong> Implemented multithreading to handle the game loop, ensuring smooth and responsive gameplay. Managed concurrent processes such as enemy spawning and collision detection to maintain performance.</li>
                <li><strong>File I/O:</strong> Integrated file input/output operations to save and load game states, high scores, and player settings. Ensured data persistence and a consistent player experience across sessions.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Additional Skills and Tools</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Design Patterns:</strong> Applied design patterns such as Singleton and Observer to solve common problems and improve code structure and readability in "Doughnut Defender."</li>
                <li><strong>Data Structures and Algorithms:</strong> Leveraged data structures such as arrays, lists, and hashmaps to manage game data efficiently. Implemented algorithms for enemy pathfinding, sorting, and searching within game logic.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>My experience with Java, particularly through the development of "Doughnut Defender," has equipped me with the skills necessary to create complex and engaging games. From designing intricate gameplay mechanics and AI systems to creating interactive user interfaces and optimizing performance, I have demonstrated the ability to bring creative game concepts to life using Java. I am eager to continue leveraging these skills in a professional setting, contributing to innovative and high-quality game development projects.</p>
